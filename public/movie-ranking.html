<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
    <p>Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is one of the most memorable performances 
        I have ever seen, and is the pinnacle of "tactful chaos."</p>

<h3>Pokémon: The First Movie</h3>
    <p>A classic from my childhood, combining the fantastical elements of Pokémon with 
        a surprisingly philosophical story about finding one's purpose in life.</p>

<h3>Safe Haven</h3>
    <p>A favorite for both my wife and me, this is a wonderful story about how love prevails 
        in the end, and what it takes to be a survivor.</p>
